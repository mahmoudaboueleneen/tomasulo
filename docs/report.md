# Report

This document provides a high-level overview of this software's lifecycle and its processes. We have outlined our approach and thinking for each process and what each process yielded. We will be covering the following processes:

1.  Architecture and Design
1.  Implementation
1.  Testing

We will also be covering other related topics and details.

## Architecture and Design

We have decided to use Object Orientation (OO) for our main logic.

Our language of choice was either going to be Java or TypeScript due to our familiarity with both, but since we knew we would develop a GUI, we opted for TypeScript so that we can also use React with TypeScript to develop the GUI, and just use one language instead of having a backend with Java and a frontend with TypeScript.
